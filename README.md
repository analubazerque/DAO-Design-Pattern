The present project is implemeting a combination of DAO, Singleton and Builder Design Patterns.
The challenge was to implement the DAO Design Pattern to access data from a database, which was accomplished.
The dababase was created using the Singleton Pattern while the Builder Pattern was used to separate the object holder from its contructor.
